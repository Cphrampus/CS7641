# Observations

## Dataset 1 (Wine)

### DT

#### basic

- obvious overfitting in training data with 100% accuracy,
but surprisingly high validation fitting around 89% 
    - likely due to such a small dataset covering enough examples

## Dataset 2 (Wine Quality)

### DT

### basic

- obvious and expected over fitting with very low
cv accuracy (55%)
  - overfit and not scalable to testing set
